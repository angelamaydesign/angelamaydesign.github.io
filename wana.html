        Insight:

      <p class="section-description">
        Wana brand focuses on wellness, professionality, and cleanliness. In Colorado, Wana Packaging has different regulations that require different icons, labels and sizes. In Arizona, you need to place a hazard warning and license warnings. In addition, the gummies will be placed into smaller boxes. We focused on being more image heavy and tried to figure out different ways to save space so that the box won't feel clunky. We decided to place labels (indica, stativa, hybrid) on the bottom and place a more minimal logo on the front while placing the larger logo and tagline on top.

        Outcome:

      <p class="section-description">
        The outcome is a unique box that fits into the wana brand focusing heavily on the flavor image while also keeping the logo prevalent. I placed the text on the sides with a small image in the back for a little flair.

        Insight:

        Wana brand focuses on wellness, professionality, and cleanliness. The original concepts would have been showcasing the gummies falling and bouncing in slow-motion macro on a white background. Unfortunately, slow-motion cameras are hard to find and was not within our budget. I tried my second concept of making a stop-motion video with copy suggested by our marketing manager, but it did not showcase the gummies enough.

      <p class="section-description">
        I stepped back and re-evaluated the direction of the video and looked at our photography to get inspiration.  The photography surrounded by wana focus on people enjoying gummies outside. I decided that focusing on the outdoors while also showcasing the gummies.

         I set the scene outdoors inspired by the wana social photos. The video shows a person opening the gummies in a child-proof container, placing the gummies in their hand from a food-safe bag, and consuming the gummies in a responsible manner.
